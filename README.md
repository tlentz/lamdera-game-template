# Elm + Lamdera Game Project Template

Template project for making a simple multiplayer game in Elm+Lamdera

This allows people to host games with specified IDs and join as players with provided names.  Player names are setup by default as unique per-game.

Some basic functionality in place:

- Frontend/Backend models
- BASIC "non-empty" validation for game/player IDs
- Communication and tracking of clients/games/players
- Some helper Commands for communication from back -> front
- Basic types to be fleshed out
- Basic handling of view function by game-state
- Deletion of Players/Games
